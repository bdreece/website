My name is Brian Reece, I am a graduate of Michigan Technological University,
having obtained a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Software Engineering, and
minoring in Communication Studies. I am passionate for writing frontend apps,
leveraging cloud infrastructure, and embedded software development.

I am currently employed as a fullstack web developer at Simms Electronics,
a software design firm for bespoke IoT solutions. At Simms, I have been
implementing backend microservices with .NET 6 on Azure Functions, developing
frontend applications using Blazor WebAssembly, and automating infrastructure
provisioning using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.

I thoroughly enjoy the unique challenges that modern web development presents:
whether that is network security, data loading, managing the API contract, or
just trying to figure out how to center a `<div>`.

I believe that IoT technologies have the potential to improve productivity and
efficacy in the medical, agricultural, and and service industries, just to name
a few.
