    <div>
        My name is Brian Reece, I am a graduate of Michigan Technological
        University, having obtained a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Software
        Engineering, and minoring in Communication Studies. I am passionate for
        efficient systems programming and embedded software development.
        
        I am currently employed as a fullstack web developer at Simms Electronics,
        a software design firm for bespoke IoT solutions. At Simms, I have been
        implementing backend microservices with .NET 6 on Azure Functions, developing
        frontend applications using Blazor WebAssembly, and automating infrastructure
        provisioning using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.
        
        I thoroughly enjoy the unique challenges that modern web development presents:
        whether that is network security, data loading, managing the API contract, or
        just trying to figure out how to center a `<div>`.
        
        I believe that IoT technologies have the potential to improve productivity and
        efficacy in the medical, agricultural, and and service industries, just to name
        a few.
