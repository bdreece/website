live :(

### [stamena](https://github.com/bdreece/stamena)

An IoT solution for competitive plant care based on the LILYGO
T-HiGrow ESP32 plant monitor, with a web portal made with Express.js
and React.

### [website](https://github.com/bdreece/website)

This website! I made this with Astro and React, and wrote all the styles using

writing new pages a breeze.
