### [transient](https://github.com/bdreece/transient)

A temporary audio file sharing and streaming service, written with Go and Vue.
I am currently in the process of migrating this to AWS, so it is not currently
live :(

### [stamena](https://github.com/bdreece/stamena)

An IoT solution for competitive plant care based on the LILYGO
T-HiGrow ESP32 plant monitor, with a web portal made with Express.js
and React.

### [portfolio](https://github.com/bdreece/portfolio)

An interactive portfolio demo styled like Windows 98. This one's still a work
in progress.

### [gollections](https://github.com/bdreece/gollections)

A Go 1.18 library for generic data structures and iterators. Designed with
minimal abstraction, lazy evaluation, and DX in mind.

### [website](https://github.com/bdreece/website)

This website! I made this with Astro and React, and wrote all the styles using
Sass stylesheets. I'm hoping that the MDX integration Astro offers will make
writing new pages a breeze.
