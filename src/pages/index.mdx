My name is Brian Reece, I am a graduate of Michigan Technological University,
having obtained a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Software Engineering, and
minoring in Communication Studies. I am passionate for writing frontend apps,
leveraging cloud infrastructure, and embedded software development. In my
free time, I enjoy playing video games, producing music, hiking, and rock
climbing.

When I am not programming or busy with my many hobbies, I am usually spending
time with my spunky, 5-month old kitten named Firefly. I am her companion just
as much as she is mine.
